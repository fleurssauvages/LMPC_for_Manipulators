# LMPC for Robotic Manipulators Project

## Overview
This project simulates Quadratic Programming (QP) and Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for robotic manipulators.
LMPC is used for path planning.
QP to solve Inverse Kinematics (IK) with constraints (joint limits for example).

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
pip install roboticstoolbox-python, numpy

An example for teleoperation uses mediapipe and opencv to map the hand motion to the robot motion:
pip install mediapipe, opencv-python
